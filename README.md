A helper for people learning Project Reactor and dont feel like creating a hot publisher. Open your terminal and run this in the background to hit the localhost endpoints that continuously stream integers that simulate stock prices.

To run this maven application simply open Terminal > navigate to the project > run java -jar stock-microservices-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
